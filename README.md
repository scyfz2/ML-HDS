Machine Learning and Data Mining for Health Data Science

## Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with prognosis influenced by multiple factors, including clinical characteristics, tumor heterogeneity, and molecular features. Traditional prognostic models rely on clinical staging and histopathology but often overlook valuable information from radiomics and genomics. Recently, machine learning (ML) has shown potential in improving prognosis prediction by integrating multimodal data. However, real-world data complexity (e.g., missing values, non-standardized variables) and model interpretability remain key challenges for clinical translation.

This study aims to explore the predictive capabilities of clinical, radiomics (tumor segmentation maps), and gene expression features for lung cancer patient survival outcomes and assess their clinical applicability. The specific objectives include:

1.	Extracting quantitative radiomic features (e.g., shape, texture) from tumor segmentation maps to construct a radiomics feature set.

2.	Comparing the independent and combined predictive performance of clinical, tumor segmentation maps, and gene expression feature sets. 

3.	Evaluating the potential benefits and limitations of multimodal predictive models in patient management, considering both performance and ethical implications.

By integrating multi-dimensional data, this study aims to provide data-driven support for personalized lung cancer management while highlighting the opportunities and limitations of machine learning in clinical practice.
